# Project 6 - Distributed Key Value Store With Raft

## My Approach:
I tried following the Raft paper as much as possible. Some details didn't make sense first, but I figured out the logic behind them as I implement the protocol.

## Challenges I Faced:
The biggest challenge I faced was log replication. Another big challenge was performance tests.

## How I Tested My Code:
I implemented a verbose mode, which allows me to see what each server sends and receives.
